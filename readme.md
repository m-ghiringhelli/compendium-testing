# PLAN

- fetch array of objects
- will need a fetch all quotes and a fetch quotes by character
- map through array of objects to render on page
- filter by character (dropdown?)
- array method to populate dropdown with character names?
- need component (QuoteCard? needs a p for quote, img for picture, h for name)
- pass object as props?
- TESTS
- test for compendium item display (check for p that has text, img, h?) 
- test for state manipulation (hmm... ask a TA. maybe it involves using a user event to simulate selecting something from the dropdown then finding an h with the name that is selected?)
